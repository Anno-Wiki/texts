    Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare early in his
    career about two young star-crossed lovers whose deaths ultimately reconcile
    their feuding families. It was among Shakespeare's most popular plays during
    his lifetime and along with Hamlet, is one of his most frequently performed
    plays. Today, the title characters are regarded as archetypal young lovers.

    Romeo and Juliet belongs to a tradition of tragic romances stretching back
    to antiquity. The plot is based on an Italian tale translated into verse as
    The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet by Arthur Brooke in 1562 and
    retold in prose in Palace of Pleasure by William Painter in 1567.
    Shakespeare borrowed heavily from both but expanded the plot by developing a
    number of supporting characters, particularly Mercutio and Paris. Believed
    to have been written between 1591 and 1595, the play was first published in
    a quarto version in 1597. The text of the first quarto version was of poor
    quality, however, and later editions corrected the text to conform more
    closely with Shakespeare's original.

    Shakespeare's use of his poetic dramatic structure (especially effects such
    as switching between comedy and tragedy to heighten tension, his expansion
    of minor characters, and his use of sub-plots to embellish the story) has
    been praised as an early sign of his dramatic skill. The play ascribes
    different poetic forms to different characters, sometimes changing the form
    as the character develops. Romeo, for example, grows more adept at the
    sonnet over the course of the play.

    Romeo and Juliet has been adapted numerous times for stage, film, musical,
    and opera venues. During the English Restoration, it was revived and heavily
    revised by William Davenant. David Garrick's 18th-century version also
    modified several scenes, removing material then considered indecent, and
    Georg Benda's Romeo und Julie omitted much of the action and added a happy
    ending. Performances in the 19th century, including Charlotte Cushman's,
    restored the original text and focused on greater realism. John Gielgud's
    1935 version kept very close to Shakespeare's text and used Elizabethan
    costumes and staging to enhance the drama. In the 20th and into the 21st
    century, the play has been adapted in versions as diverse as George Cukor's
    1936 film Romeo and Juliet, Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 version Romeo and
    Juliet, and Baz Luhrmann's 1996 MTV-inspired Romeo + Juliet.

              ==============

              William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616) was an
              English poet, playwright and actor, widely regarded as the
              greatest writer in the English language and the world’s greatest
              dramatist. He is often called England’s national poet and the
              “Bard of Avon”. His extant works, including collaborations,
              consist of approximately 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative
              poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His
              plays have been translated into every major living language and
              are performed more often than those of any other playwright.

              Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon,
              Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with
              whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith.
              Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in
              London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company
              called the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, later known as the King’s Men.
              At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford,
              where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare’s
              private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation
              about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his
              religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were
              written by others. Such theories are often criticised for failing
              to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of
              the period.

              Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and
              1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and
              are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres.
              Until about 1608, he wrote mainly tragedies, among them Hamlet,
              Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the
              finest works in the English language. In the last phase of his
              life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) and
              collaborated with other playwrights.

              Many of Shakespeare’s plays were published in editions of varying
              quality and accuracy in his lifetime. However, in 1623, two fellow
              actors and friends of Shakespeare’s, John Heminges and Henry
              Condell, published a more definitive text known as the First
              Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare’s dramatic
              works that included all but two of his plays. The volume was
              prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Jonson presciently
              hails Shakespeare in a now-famous quote as “not of an age, but for
              all time”.

              Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Shakespeare’s works have
              been continually adapted and rediscovered by new movements in
              scholarship and performance. His plays remain popular and are
              studied, performed, and reinterpreted through various cultural and
              political contexts around the world.
