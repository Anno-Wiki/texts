Alright, so this play is a jerk.

I never liked this play. It's too intense and I don't at all feel that the moor
is noble. A noble man doesn't kill a woman out of jealousy. He leaves her.

So anyway.

The gutenberg version is badly formatted. I mean *really* badly formatted. But I
realized a simple truth about this whole process: shakespeare.mit.edu has all of
shakespeare's plays already encoded, for free, as html. Well, BeautifulSoup4
might just have a thing to say about that!

I will be writing a (hopefully) regularized parser. That might allow me to parse
*all* of Shakespeare's works in a simple go, just using a scraper (requests) and
a parser (BeautifulSoup4).

As such, I think it's time to let the bard rest. If Romeo & Juliet is easy to
parse, I'll parse it with my new formatter right now, but otherwise, time to
move on to Iliad/Odyssey and perhaps other works.
