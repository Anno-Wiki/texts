toc:
    'ACT': act
    'SCENE': scene
specials:
    '^[A-Z]+\.$': char

I'm not going to go for the stage directions as it seems like it would be
utterly useless to do so.

I seem to have prepared most of the file into the proper bounds. The TOC is easy
to find. Quotes and indents (thank god for those) seem to cover the rest of it.
I'll need an ind3 and ind4 to properly account for it all. Plus I still don't
have a quote style so I'll have to do that.

I definitely need to suppress the line break system. That is grossly
problematic.
