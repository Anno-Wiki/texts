description: 'Coriolanus ( or ) is a tragedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have
  been written between 1605 and 1608. The play is based on the life of the legendary
  Roman leader Caius Marcius Coriolanus. The tragedy is one of the last two tragedies
  written by Shakespeare, along with Antony and Cleopatra.

  Coriolanus is the name given to a Roman general after his more than adequate military
  success against various uprisings challenging the government of Rome. Following
  this success, Coriolanus becomes active in politics and seeks political leadership.
  His temperament is unsuited for popular leadership and he is quickly deposed, whereupon
  he aligns himself to set matters straight according to his own will. The alliances
  he forges along the way result in his ultimate downfall.'

    description: "From Wikipedia\n==============\n\nWilliam Shakespeare (bapt. 26\
      \ April 1564 \u2013 23 April 1616) was an\nEnglish poet, playwright and actor,\
      \ widely regarded as the\ngreatest writer in the English language and the world\u2019\
      s greatest\ndramatist. He is often called England\u2019s national poet and the\n\
      \u201CBard of Avon\u201D. His extant works, including collaborations,\nconsist\
      \ of approximately 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative\npoems, and a few\
      \ other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His\nplays have been translated\
      \ into every major living language and\nare performed more often than those\
      \ of any other playwright.\n\nShakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon,\n\
      Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with\nwhom he had\
      \ three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith.\nSometime between 1585\
      \ and 1592, he began a successful career in\nLondon as an actor, writer, and\
      \ part-owner of a playing company\ncalled the Lord Chamberlain\u2019s Men, later\
      \ known as the King\u2019s Men.\nAt age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have\
      \ retired to Stratford,\nwhere he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare\u2019\
      s\nprivate life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation\nabout\
      \ such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his\nreligious beliefs,\
      \ and whether the works attributed to him were\nwritten by others. Such theories\
      \ are often criticised for failing\nto adequately note that few records survive\
      \ of most commoners of\nthe period.\n\nShakespeare produced most of his known\
      \ works between 1589 and\n1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and\
      \ histories and\nare regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres.\n\
      Until about 1608, he wrote mainly tragedies, among them Hamlet,\nOthello, King\
      \ Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the\nfinest works in the English\
      \ language. In the last phase of his\nlife, he wrote tragicomedies (also known\
      \ as romances) and\ncollaborated with other playwrights.\n\nMany of Shakespeare\u2019\
      s plays were published in editions of varying\nquality and accuracy in his lifetime.\
      \ However, in 1623, two fellow\nactors and friends of Shakespeare\u2019s, John\
      \ Heminges and Henry\nCondell, published a more definitive text known as the\
      \ First\nFolio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare\u2019s dramatic\n\
      works that included all but two of his plays. The volume was\nprefaced with\
      \ a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Jonson presciently\nhails Shakespeare in a\
      \ now-famous quote as \u201Cnot of an age, but for\nall time\u201D.\n\nThroughout\
      \ the 20th and 21st centuries, Shakespeare\u2019s works have\nbeen continually\
      \ adapted and rediscovered by new movements in\nscholarship and performance.\
      \ His plays remain popular and are\nstudied, performed, and reinterpreted through\
      \ various cultural and\npolitical contexts around the world.\n"
