  \ Set in Denmark, the play depicts Prince Hamlet and his\nrevenge against his uncle,\
  \ Claudius, who has murdered Hamlet\u2019s father in\norder to seize his throne\
  \ and marry Hamlet\u2019s mother.\n\nHamlet is Shakespeare\u2019s longest play and\
  \ is considered among the most\npowerful and influential works of world literature,\
  \ with a story capable of\n\u201Cseemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others\u201D\
  . It was one of\nShakespeare\u2019s most popular works during his lifetime and still\
  \ ranks among\nhis most performed, topping the performance list of the Royal Shakespeare\n\
  Company and its predecessors in Stratford-upon-Avon since 1879. It has\ninspired\
  \ many other writers\u2014from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Charles\nDickens to\
  \ James Joyce and Iris Murdoch\u2014and has been described as \u201Cthe\nworld\u2019\
  s most filmed story after Cinderella\u201D.\n\nThe story of Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet\
  \ was derived from the legend of Amleth,\npreserved by 13th-century chronicler Saxo\
  \ Grammaticus in his Gesta Danorum,\nas subsequently retold by the 16th-century\
  \ scholar Fran\xE7ois de Belleforest.\nShakespeare may also have drawn on an earlier\
  \ Elizabethan play known today\nas the Ur-Hamlet, though some scholars believe Shakespeare\
  \ wrote the\nUr-Hamlet, later revising it to create the version of Hamlet we now\
  \ have. He\nalmost certainly wrote his version of the title role for his fellow\
  \ actor,\nRichard Burbage, the leading tragedian of Shakespeare\u2019s time. In\
  \ the 400\nyears since its inception, the role has been performed by numerous highly\n\
  acclaimed actors in each successive century.\n\nThree different early versions of\
  \ the play are extant: the First Quarto (Q1,\n1603); the Second Quarto (Q2, 1604);\
  \ and the First Folio (F1, 1623). Each\nversion includes lines and entire scenes\
  \ missing from the others. The play\u2019s\nstructure and depth of characterisation\
  \ have inspired much critical\nscrutiny. One such example is the centuries-old debate\
  \ about Hamlet\u2019s\nhesitation to kill his uncle, which some see as merely a\
  \ plot device to\nprolong the action but which others argue is a dramatisation of\
  \ the complex\nphilosophical and ethical issues that surround cold-blooded murder,\n\
  calculated revenge, and thwarted desire. More recently, psychoanalytic\ncritics\
  \ have examined Hamlet\u2019s unconscious desires, while feminist critics\nhave\
  \ re-evaluated and attempted to rehabilitate the often-maligned\ncharacters of Ophelia\
  \ and Gertrude.\n"

    description: "From Wikipedia\n==============\n\nWilliam Shakespeare (bapt. 26\
      \ April 1564 \u2013 23 April 1616) was an\nEnglish poet, playwright and actor,\
      \ widely regarded as the\ngreatest writer in the English language and the world\u2019\
      s greatest\ndramatist. He is often called England\u2019s national poet and the\n\
      \u201CBard of Avon\u201D. His extant works, including collaborations,\nconsist\
      \ of approximately 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative\npoems, and a few\
      \ other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His\nplays have been translated\
      \ into every major living language and\nare performed more often than those\
      \ of any other playwright.\n\nShakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon,\n\
      Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with\nwhom he had\
      \ three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith.\nSometime between 1585\
      \ and 1592, he began a successful career in\nLondon as an actor, writer, and\
      \ part-owner of a playing company\ncalled the Lord Chamberlain\u2019s Men, later\
      \ known as the King\u2019s Men.\nAt age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have\
      \ retired to Stratford,\nwhere he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare\u2019\
      s\nprivate life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation\nabout\
      \ such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his\nreligious beliefs,\
      \ and whether the works attributed to him were\nwritten by others. Such theories\
      \ are often criticised for failing\nto adequately note that few records survive\
      \ of most commoners of\nthe period.\n\nShakespeare produced most of his known\
      \ works between 1589 and\n1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and\
      \ histories and\nare regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres.\n\
      Until about 1608, he wrote mainly tragedies, among them Hamlet,\nOthello, King\
      \ Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the\nfinest works in the English\
      \ language. In the last phase of his\nlife, he wrote tragicomedies (also known\
      \ as romances) and\ncollaborated with other playwrights.\n\nMany of Shakespeare\u2019\
      s plays were published in editions of varying\nquality and accuracy in his lifetime.\
      \ However, in 1623, two fellow\nactors and friends of Shakespeare\u2019s, John\
      \ Heminges and Henry\nCondell, published a more definitive text known as the\
      \ First\nFolio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare\u2019s dramatic\n\
      works that included all but two of his plays. The volume was\nprefaced with\
      \ a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Jonson presciently\nhails Shakespeare in a\
      \ now-famous quote as \u201Cnot of an age, but for\nall time\u201D.\n\nThroughout\
      \ the 20th and 21st centuries, Shakespeare\u2019s works have\nbeen continually\
      \ adapted and rediscovered by new movements in\nscholarship and performance.\
      \ His plays remain popular and are\nstudied, performed, and reinterpreted through\
      \ various cultural and\npolitical contexts around the world.\n"

  description: "Three early editions of the text have survived, making attempts to\n\
    establish a single \u201Cauthentic\u201D text problematic and inconclusive Each\n\
    surviving edition differs from the other:\n\n- First Quarto (Q1): In 1603 the\
    \ booksellers Nicholas Ling and John\n  Trundell published, and Valentine Simmes\
    \ printed, the so-called \u201Cbad\u201D\n  first quarto, under the name The Tragicall\
    \ Historie of Hamlet Prince\n  of Denmarke. Q1 contains just over half of the\
    \ text of the later\n  second quarto.\n- Second Quarto (Q2): In 1604 Nicholas\
    \ Ling published, and James Roberts\n  printed, the second quarto, under the same\
    \ name as the first. Some\n  copies are dated 1605, which may indicate a second\
    \ impression;\n  consequently, Q2 is often dated \u201C1604/5\u201D. Q2 is the\
    \ longest early\n  edition, although it omits about 77 lines found in F1 (most\
    \ likely to\n  avoid offending James I\u2019s queen, Anne of Denmark)\n- First\
    \ Folio (F1): In 1623 Edward Blount and William and Isaac Jaggard\n  published\
    \ The Tragedie of Hamlet, Prince of Denmarke in the First\n  Folio, the first\
    \ edition of Shakespeare\u2019s Complete Works.\n\nOther folios and quartos were\
    \ subsequently published\u2014including John\nSmethwick\u2019s Q3, Q4, and Q5\
    \ (1611\u201337)\u2014but these are regarded as\nderivatives of the first three\
    \ editions.\n\nEarly editors of Shakespeare\u2019s works, beginning with Nicholas\
    \ Rowe\n(1709) and Lewis Theobald (1733), combined material from the two\nearliest\
    \ sources of Hamlet available at the time, Q2 and F1. Each text\ncontains material\
    \ that the other lacks, with many minor differences in\nwording: scarcely 200\
    \ lines are identical in the two. Editors have\ncombined them in an effort to\
    \ create one \u201Cinclusive\u201D text that reflects\nan imagined \u201Cideal\u201D\
    \ of Shakespeare\u2019s original. Theobald\u2019s version became\nstandard for\
    \ a long time, and his \u201Cfull text\u201D approach continues to\ninfluence\
    \ editorial practice to the present day. Some contemporary\nscholarship, however,\
    \ discounts this approach, instead considering \u201Can\nauthentic Hamlet an unrealisable\
    \ ideal. ... there are texts of this play\nbut no text\u201D. The 2006 publication\
    \ by Arden Shakespeare of different\nHamlet texts in different volumes is perhaps\
    \ evidence of this shifting\nfocus and emphasis. Other editors have continued\
    \ to argue the need for\nwell-edited editions taking material from all versions\
    \ of the play.\nColin Burrow has argued that \u201Cmost of us should read a text\
    \ that is made\nup by conflating all three versions ... it\u2019s about as likely\
    \ that\nShakespeare wrote: \u2018To be or not to be, ay, there\u2019s the point\u2019\
    \ [in Q1],\nas that he wrote the works of Francis Bacon. I suspect most people\
    \ just\nwon\u2019t want to read a three-text play ... [multi-text editions are]\
    \ a\nversion of the play that is out of touch with the needs of a wider\npublic.\u201D\
    \n\nTraditionally, editors of Shakespeare\u2019s plays have divided them into\n\
    five acts. None of the early texts of Hamlet, however, were arranged\nthis way,\
    \ and the play\u2019s division into acts and scenes derives from a\n1676 quarto.\
    \ Modern editors generally follow this traditional division\nbut consider it unsatisfactory;\
    \ for example, after Hamlet drags\nPolonius\u2019s body out of Gertrude\u2019\
    s bedchamber, there is an act-break\nafter which the action appears to continue\
    \ uninterrupted.\n\nThe discovery in 1823 of Q1\u2014whose existence had been\
    \ quite\nunsuspected\u2014caused considerable interest and excitement, raising\
    \ many\nquestions of editorial practice and interpretation. Scholars immediately\n\
    identified apparent deficiencies in Q1, which was instrumental in the\ndevelopment\
    \ of the concept of a Shakespearean \u201Cbad quarto\u201D. Yet Q1 has\nvalue:\
    \ it contains stage directions (such as Ophelia entering with a\nlute and her\
    \ hair down) that reveal actual stage practices in a way that\nQ2 and F1 do not;\
    \ it contains an entire scene (usually labelled 4.6)\nthat does not appear in\
    \ either Q2 or F1; and it is useful for comparison\nwith the later editions. The\
    \ major deficiency of Q1 is in the language:\nparticularly noticeable in the opening\
    \ lines of the famous \u201CTo be, or\nnot to be\u201D soliloquy: \u201CTo be,\
    \ or not to be, aye there\u2019s the point. / To\ndie, to sleep, is that all?\
    \ Aye all: / No, to sleep, to dream, aye marry\nthere it goes.\u201D However,\
    \ the scene order is more coherent, without the\nproblems of Q2 and F1 of Hamlet\
    \ seeming to resolve something in one\nscene and enter the next drowning in indecision.\
    \ New Cambridge editor\nKathleen Irace has noted that \u201CQ1\u2019s more linear\
    \ plot design is certainly\neasier [...] to follow [...] but the simplicity of\
    \ the Q1 plot\narrangement eliminates the alternating plot elements that correspond\
    \ to\nHamlet\u2019s shifts in mood.\u201D\n\nQ1 is considerably shorter than Q2\
    \ or F1 and may be a memorial\nreconstruction of the play as Shakespeare\u2019\
    s company performed it, by an\nactor who played a minor role (most likely Marcellus).\
    \ Scholars disagree\nwhether the reconstruction was pirated or authorised. It\
    \ is suggested by\nIrace that Q1 is an abridged version intended especially for\
    \ travelling\nproductions, thus the question of length may be considered as separate\n\
    from issues of poor textual quality.  Editing Q1 thus poses problems in\nwhether\
    \ or not to \u201Ccorrect\u201D differences from Q2 and F. Irace, in her\nintroduction\
    \ to Q1, wrote that \u201CI have avoided as many other alterations\nas possible,\
    \ because the differences...are especially intriguing...I\nhave recorded a selection\
    \ of Q2/F readings in the collation.\u201D The idea\nthat Q1 is not riddled with\
    \ error but is instead eminently fit for the\nstage has led to at least 28 different\
    \ Q1 productions since 1881. Other\nproductions have used the probably superior\
    \ Q2 and Folio texts, but used\nQ1\u2019s running order, in particular moving\
    \ the to be or not to be\nsoliloquy earlier.  Developing this, some editors such\
    \ as Jonathan Bate\nhave argued that Q2 may represent \u201Ca \u2018reading\u2019\
    \ text as opposed to a\n\u2018performance\u2019 one\u201D of Hamlet, analogous\
    \ to how modern films released on\ndisc may include deleted scenes: an edition\
    \ containing all of\nShakespeare\u2019s material for the play for the pleasure\
    \ of readers, so not\nrepresenting the play as it would have been staged.\n"
